# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** is a project designed to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and past interactions. The system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze user data and suggest movies tailored to individual tastes.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Delivers tailored movie suggestions based on user profiles and interaction history.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies similar to the ones a user has liked.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Suggests movies based on the preferences of other users with similar tastes.
- **Hybrid Model:** Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for improved accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for seamless interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks:** Flask/Django (for the web interface)
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas and NumPy for data processing
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning models
  - Surprise for collaborative filtering
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- **Database:** SQLite/MySQL for storing user and movie data

## Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.8 or higher**
2. **Required Libraries:** Install dependencies using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Dataset:** Obtain a movie dataset such as [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). Ensure it is placed in the `data` directory.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   - If using SQLite, ensure the database file `movies.db` exists in the project root.
   - Run migrations (if applicable).

## Usage
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Access the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
3. Create an account or log in.
4. Explore movie recommendations and search for movies.

## Project Structure
- **`app.py`**: Main application file.
- **`data/`**: Contains datasets used for training and testing.
- **`models/`**: Machine learning models.
- **`templates/`**: HTML templates for the web interface.
- **`static/`**: Static files like CSS and JavaScript.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** Collects data on users, movies, and interactions (e.g., ratings, reviews).
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses the data to prepare it for model training.
3. **Model Training:**
   - Content-based filtering using metadata like genres, actors, and directors.
   - Collaborative filtering using user-item interaction matrices.
4. **Recommendation:** Generates and displays recommendations for users.

## Future Enhancements
- **Incorporate Deep Learning:** Use neural networks for enhanced recommendations.
- **Real-Time Recommendations:** Implement real-time data processing for dynamic suggestions.
- **Mobile Application:** Develop a mobile app for Android and iOS.
- **Multilingual Support:** Add support for multiple languages.
